Startup HQ
=============

Startup HQ is my first ever startup :), hopefully the first of many successes.
<!--break-->
 What is Startup HQ? Startup HQ is a web platform i am designing for startups around the world to find partners and resources at a startup cost. As most startup owners know building a startup from the ground up is tough and finding a team is the most important thing on the list of a new startup. At the beginning a startup cant offer anything to a partner other than to bost a "you will own blah amount of this company", what happens when you give a partner a big amount of your company and find out that the partnership is not working well? Startup HQ gives startups the ability to form teams with the ability to show around! Big companies can pick and choose their employees why cant startups?

I will be updating this post in the future. Stay tuned :)
